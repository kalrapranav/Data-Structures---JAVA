# Store Checkout System

---

For this assignment, you will create a portion of a retail store checkout system.
For this assignment you have both data structures and an application to develop.
The application provides fast lookup for product information. 
A clerk (or customer) inputs a product stock number and the system returns the record for that item.

The system is designed to provide facilities to add, remove and look up items, along with certain other utility functions.
	* Your project will use theDictionaryADTinterface (provided) to support your application program. 
	* The dictionary takes key-value pairs.
	* Each key must be distinct; no duplicates are allowed. There may be duplicate values.
